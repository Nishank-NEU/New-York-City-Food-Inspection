# New-York-City-Food-Inspection
Overview : 
This project focuses on analyzing data related to food inspections in New York City. The objective is to gain insights into food safety standards, inspection outcomes, and trends across various establishments in the city. The project implements ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques, starting with the creation of a dimensional model using ER Studio, followed by data preparation, cleaning, and visualization using Alteryx, Power BI, and Tableau.

Dataset : 
The dataset used in this project contains information about food inspections conducted in New York City. It includes details such as inspection date, establishment type, violation codes, inspection results, and more. Analyzing this dataset can provide valuable insights into the food safety landscape of New York City.

Process : 
Dimensional Model Creation: The project began with the creation of a dimensional model using ER Studio. This model helped in organizing and structuring the data for efficient analysis and querying. The model was then converted into SQL scripts to create a new database.

Data Preparation and Profiling with Alteryx: Following the dimensional model creation, the next step involved data preparation and profiling using Alteryx. This stage aimed to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and assess data quality.

Data Cleaning, Transforming, and Staging: After data profiling, the dataset underwent cleaning, transforming, and staging processes. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and preparing the data for analysis. The cleaned and transformed data was then staged for loading into the database.

Database Storage: The cleaned and transformed data was stored in the newly created database. This ensured that the data is organized and accessible for further analysis and querying.

Visualization with Power BI and Tableau: The final step of the project involved visualizing the insights extracted from the data using both Power BI and Tableau. Various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards were created to showcase key trends and patterns in food inspection outcomes across New York City.
